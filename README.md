"In order to complete the group work you will need to work with another student. It is important that you evenly distribute the work between yourselves and work effectively with each other.  You are required to keep a diary so that you log and minute all communication and meetings. The diary will be required as part of the evidence in the portfolio."

"You must also supply one peer-assessment form for each group member. This will need to be agreed and signed by each group member. The peer assessment template is available on the module web page. Completed forms need to be scanned or photographed and need to be uploaded as part of your group work assessment."
